                            When she saw the health of one of her clients deteriorate due to kidney failure, she decided to help by donating her

                            "If I know that I've got something that can help somebody else, I just don't see why I wouldn't do it. To be honest, it
                            wasn't a big decision. I knew that you don't need money to help somebody ."says Nina.
                            The client's kidney transplant was successful and now she is doing
                            fine. Thank you Nina for your unconditional love!</i>
